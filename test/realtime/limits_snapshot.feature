Feature: Provide forecast limits in appropriate formats

    As a Clearinghouse Operator
    I want to provide realtime limits in a variety of formats
    when a client requests and appropriate media type
    So that clients can obtain the data in the format they need
    Without defining a generalized query capability, like OData or GraphQL
